Learning how to use get hub
Hello, my name is Robert. I am a 35-year-old with a wife and three children. My current career is Industrial maintenance.
My skills include Robotic maintenance, PLC troubleshooting, electrical troubleshooting, etc. I love the troubleshooting side of my job but I do not like the environment. Therefore, I hope to get on a path that will allow me to be a programmer.
I have a 2-year degree in HVAC. Part of the curriculum to obtain that degree was an HTML class. This class opened my eyes to the realm of programming and being able to create environments through the CPU. I still lacked understanding of just how much coding was used in our world. I also did not have the confidence that programming was something I could do. 
After years of experience with PLC's and Robotics learning a brief stint into coding of this type of equipment sprung the interest back into me to try to change careers. 
Here’s to those Hopes and Dreams, Let’s Make Them a Reality!
